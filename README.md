# SpatialOrientationVR_SpatialCog
This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for the two perceptual experiments reported in 

*Assessing effects of reduced vision on spatial orientation ability using Virtual Reality.* M.Kinateder & E.A. Cooper, Conference Proceedings of Spatial Cognition, 2021.

# Data files
Data are saved in the Data directory and organized in tables with headers that can be read into R or similar tools for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2.

# Analysis scripts
The R scripts reproduce figures 5-8 in the article, and require the "tidyverse" and "ggExtra" package (as of 2021-05-09).

If you are using Rstudio, open the Rproj file to set the working directory and navigate to the scripts. If you are not using Rstudio, make sure to set the correct working directory to load the files.
